# Real World Design Patterns üó∫Ô∏è
Explore real-world scenarios and best practices for design patterns in this comprehensive repository. Elevate your software design skills with practical examples and insightful discussions. ‚ú® This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos ¬∑ Fast CI.](https://nx.dev) ‚ú®

## How to Learn? üìñ
For each design pattern, there is folder based on `TypeScript`. If you are comming from another programming language world, don't worry. They are not complicated.

You can open directory, for instance:

```
$ cd app/strategy-pattern
```

There is a `README` file that you can review first.

## Structure of Readme

Here is some steps in each `README` file:

- üí° Use Case: a short description about the specific problem that we want to solve.
- ‚ùå Bad Practice: a typical solution that works but not in a proper way.
- ‚úÖ Good Practice: implementing the specified design pattern to solve the problem in a proper way.

Diagram: There is also a diagram to represent the oveview of the design pattern to understand better. This is an example:

![design-pattern-diagram](assets/command-pattern.jpg)
![design-pattern-diagram](assets/chain-of-res.jpg)

See `/app` folder for all design patterns. ‚úÖ

## How to Run

In the root directory, run:

```
$ npm install
```

To run the design pattern:

```
$ npm run -w PATTERN_NAME start
```

For instance **PATTERN_NAME** can be strategy-pattern


To run the bad practice:

```
$ npm run -w PATTERN_NAME start:bad
```

## Run Tests

In order to run tests, run the following command. (add `:watch` to run it in watch mode):

```
$ npm run test
```

## Test Coverage

Run the following command to evaluate test coverage:

```
$ npm run test:cov
```

To see the coverage report, just run:

```
$ npm run test:cov:open
```

Use modern ESNext features (async/await, const, let, destructuring).

Code must be self-contained, minimal, and focused on the design pattern.

Include only relevant code, avoid unnecessary complexity, frameworks, or dependencies.

Always write clean code.

The goal is to demonstrate design pattern, so whenever some external service is required (e.g. database connection or http request), just do `console.log('connecting to databse');`

Always check one of the patterns to keep consistency.

Implement the pattern based on the prompt.
